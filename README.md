# üïπÔ∏è	3D-pong

Rediscover the famous pong game restyled in 3D with new gameplay mechanics!

## Warning

When I developed this project, I had no intention to make it public, by that I used few paid assets (for power-ups particles) therefore, I had to remove them from the repository to not make them accessible for free. This means you will not be able to compile the project without tweaking a bit the scripts.

Other than that, the rest is free and you can use the scripts as you wish.

You can play the game directly on my itch.io page: https://antotogames.itch.io/3d-pong

Ref of the power-ups model if you want to: https://unityassets4free.com/polygon-particle-fx/

## Rules

The game is playable in 1 vs 1 local multiplayer (Playing alone is also possible if you want to).

If the ball reach the goal (behind the player stick) the ball sender will see his score increased by one (If the other player does not have life power-up)

There is no score limite, the game is infinite until you restart or go back to the main menu.


## Features

- 5 power-ups (See help section in game for detailed information)

- Random obstacles spawning

- Time evolutive ball speed
